# Colophon (about this site)

## Content

I mostly write my posts in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). I respect what they're trying to build over there so I pay for Obsidian Sync. Some of the content is written in my code editor of choice, [neovim](https://neovim.io) running [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) at time of writing.

## Design

Bare bones HTML templates and CSS, with a few theming CSS variables at least. The font is the Overpass font by Delve Withrington via [Nerd Fonts](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#overpass).

## Tech

The site is built with the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) static site generator. I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to host the site and [GitHub](https://github.com) to store the source code. My content is stored in a private repo and vendored in as a Git submodule, and I wrote an adapter plugin between Obsidian and Eleventy.
